# Image Processing Projects

Welcome to the Image Processing Projects repository! This collection of Python scripts leverages popular libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib to perform various image processing tasks. Each project is designed to showcase specific functionalities and can be used as a starting point for further exploration and customization.



# Image Inpainting App

This Python script uses Tkinter for the GUI, OpenCV for image processing, and Pillow (PIL) for image display. The application allows users to inpaint an image based on a selected mask.

## Instructions

1. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
2. Click the "Inpaint Image" button.
3. Select an image file and a corresponding mask file when prompted.
4. The inpainted result will be displayed in the GUI.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter
- OpenCV
- Pillow (PIL)

# Image Damage Inpainting

This Python script utilizes OpenCV and Matplotlib to detect and inpaint damaged regions in an image.

## Instructions

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib

# Image Edge Detection

This Python script utilizes OpenCV and Matplotlib to perform edge detection on an image.

## Instructions

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib


# Image Boundary Conditions

This Python script uses OpenCV and NumPy to manipulate pixel values in an image and print boundary conditions.

## Instructions

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy
# Colored Image Inpainting with Marked Area

This Python script uses OpenCV to inpaint a marked area in a color image with linear interpolation.

## Instructions

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy
